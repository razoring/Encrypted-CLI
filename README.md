# Nodenet: Privacy made simple
A **peer-to-peer** chat service secured with **end-to-end RSA encryption** that runs in your CLI. No external dependencies, built all from scratch.

## Chat Securely
When a connection is established, a public and private key are generated and the public keys are exchanged by each connection. a Encryption is secured by the client using a unique public key and decryption is handled by the receipient using their unique private key. Keys are randomly generated integers between **10 000 to 99 999** â€” which is **90 000** unique possible combinations.

#### Chats do not save.
